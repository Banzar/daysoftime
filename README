This is incase you are as strange as myself and wonder how old you are in days. It is not just used for your birthday though, I found it can basically be used for many other things. It even tells you what day of the week it was on the date that you choose.. 

This could have been done with much less code in my opinion, if I had used "require 'date'" and did Date.leaps(year) but I wanted to use the arrays. I have never thought of anything I needed them for, and this seemed the first thing I was able to make using in array in any language.

For some reason it works perfectly on windows, but linux it seems to have an error.

Will work on this until it is fixed..
